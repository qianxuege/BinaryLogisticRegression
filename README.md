## Description
This is a working Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that determines whether a restaurant review is positive or negative, using binary logistic regression.

### Feature Engineering
`feature.py` takes in the raw input data and produces a real-valued vector for each training, validation, and test example.  
`glove_embeddings.txt` contains the GloVe embeddings of 6792 words, used for feature engineering.

### Binary Logistic Regression
`lr.py` takes in the real-valued vectors and trains a logistic regression model using stochastic gradient descent to predict whether each example is a positive or negative review.  
`nll.py` plots the average negative log-likelihood for the training and validation data sets after each of 1,000 epochs. The y-axis shows the negative log-likelihood and the x-axis shows the number of epochs. It demonstrates the effect of overfitting, in which as the number of epochs increase, the model is learning details from the training data that donâ€™t generalize well to the validation data.
